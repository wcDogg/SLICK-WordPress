CURRENT

I'm having a problem with single.php that began when I rest my stage environment in preparation for a theme and ACF update. 

page.php 
-- parts/content-page.php - IS working ^^

single.php
-- parts/content-post.php (blog) - NOT working ^^
-- parts/content-lubricant.php (CPT) - IS working
-- parts/content-offer.php (CPT) - IS working

^^ content-page.php and content-post.php are identical. 

If you look at a blog post, you'll see no post parts or errors are displayed - like it doesn't recognize single.php or content-post.php ... and isn't falling back to index.php or content.php ... and it has no idea there's a problem.    

BACKGROUND

I originally saw this issue when I first rested my stage environment. At that time it affected both Posts and Pages, while my CPTs were fine. 

Instead of doing another reset or otherwise fixing the issue before moving ahead, I stupidly did my updates. 

I got everything working in stage except for one non-critical template part that works on Page but not Post. 

I ignored that problem and pushed my staged updates to the live site.

On the live site, Posts weren't displaying but Page and CPT were fine. At suggestion of chat support, I tried moving my staged changes a second time, and that seemed to fie the Post issue. 

So I went back to solving the mystery of why a shared part was working for Page and not Post when both are identical. 

One thing I did was rename the part. And that's when Post stopped showing parts again.
